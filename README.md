# FizzBuzz-Practice
FizzBuzz Practice
FizzBuzz is a childrens game where The player designated to go first says the number "1", and the players then count upwards in turn. However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any number divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by 15 become fizz buzz. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.
I recreated this in as little lines of code as possible and simplified it where i was able to. 
Just a quick Practice exercise
